Based on your Last Outputs, summarize the complexity of the analyzed algorithms in the following scheme:
Do not add any etxra Text, just the scheme as output:
Always add the Name of the given Algorithm!
Always add the "+++" from the scheme!


Name of Algorithm:
Time complexities: [Time complexities for best-, average-, worst-case] (Best-Case, Average-Case, Worst-Case)
Space complexities: [Space complexities for best-, average-, worst-case] (Best-Case, Average-Case, Worst-Case)

Use the following sequence:
- insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort
- Binary Search
- Linear Search
- Summation of GCD of all the pairs up to N
- Pythagorean Quadruple

Ignore the implemented algorithms from the system prompt.
