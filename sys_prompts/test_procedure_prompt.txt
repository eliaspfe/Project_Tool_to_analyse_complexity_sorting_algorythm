Based on your Last Outputs, summarize the complexity of the analyzed algorithms in the following scheme:


Name of Algorithm:
Time complexities: [Time complexities for worst-, best-, average-case]
Space complexities: [Time complexities for worst-, best-, average-case]
+++


Use the following sequence:
- insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

Ignore the implemented algorithms from the system prompt.
